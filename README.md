## python_projects

### On its own, this repo contains some projects in Python, from basic codes to advanced scripts. There aren't complex apps; however, if youâ€™re an office worker, administrator, academic, or anyone else who uses a computer for work or fun, you will find the basics of programming so that you can automate simple tasks such as the following:
- Moving and renaming thousands of files and sorting them into folders
- Filling out online forms, no typing required
- Downloading files or copying text from a website whenever it updates
- Having your computer text you custom notifications
- Updating or formatting Excel spreadsheets
- Checking your email and sending out prewritten responses
